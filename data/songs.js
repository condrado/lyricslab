        artist: 'Audioslave',

        lyrics: `Someone falls to pieces
Sleepin all alone
Someone kills the pain
Spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited
In a chapel yard
Catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen
White roses on a grave
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
Someone finds salvation in everyone
And another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself
Down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love
Untill the end of time
Another runs away
Separate or united!
Healthy or insane!
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
Even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart
Or been held up
Every single memory of
The good or bad, faces of love
Dont lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose
But to be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do 
To be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can do.`,

        lyrics: `Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Del Tha Funky Homosapien]
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

[2D + (Del Tha Funky Homosapien)]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Del Tha Funky Homosapien]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future`,

        youtubeId: 'v2H4l9RpkwM',
        lyrics: `Memories consume like opening the wounds
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
Because inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know, it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than any time before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
Because inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
Because I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight`,

        youtubeId: 'kXYiU_JCYtU',
        lyrics: `I'm tired of being what you want me to be,
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface,
Don't know what you're expecting of me,
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you,
[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there,
I've become so tired
So much more aware,
I'm becoming this
All I want to do,
Is be more like me
And be less like you,

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly
afraid to lose control,
'Cause everything that you thought I would be,
Has fallen apart
right in front of you,
[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you,
[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]
And every second I waste is more than I can take,

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there,
I've become so tired
So much more aware,
I'm becoming this
All I want to do,
Is be more like me
And be less like you,

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you,

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there,
I've become so tired
So much more aware,
I'm becoming this
All I want to do,
Is be more like me
And be less like you,

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there,
I'm tired of being what you want me to be,
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there,
I'm tired of being what you want me to be`,

        lyrics: `Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tired hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city
You, what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder
More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city
Now, what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder
You, you what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder? 
Now somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder
When I became the sun
I shone life into the man's hearts
When I became the sun
I shone life into the man's hearts`,

        lyrics: `And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where ya going to tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
Would you even care?

And I feel it
And I feel it

Where ya going to tomorrow?
Where ya going with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

And I feel, so much depends on the weather
So is it raining in your bedroom?
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
Would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it

Where ya going to tomorrow?
Where ya going with that mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

And I feel it
And she feels it

Where ya going to tomorrow?
Where ya going with that mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

Where ya going to tomorrow?
Where ya going with that mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

To find it
To find it
To find it`,
